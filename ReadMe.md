# C++ Tutorial Samples

This repository contains C++ sample codes that I adopted from various sources to help instruct programming in C++ in 2005. These samples try to help newcomers quickly find an appropriate pattern for solving their programming problems. Also they can quickly find out how a certain language construct, or a popular function is generally used.

These samples are by no means complete, nor free from deficiencies. Feel free to make them complete or introduce them to more C++ newbies or teachers. The samples cover only the standard/ISO C++ language.

To access or contribute the most recent modifications of these samples, find their github repository here: <https://github.com/sinairv/Cpp-Tutorial-Samples> 

## Running the Samples

Each sample has a separate folder of its own, and is usually in a file named Prog.cpp.

- [Configure CLion on Windows](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/quick-tutorial-on-configuring-clion-on-windows.html)

- `git clone https://github.com/e45240/Cpp-Tutorial-Samples.git`

- open the project and view each sample's source code as you wish.

## References

Beside several Internet sources, the following are the main references that I used during the course of creating these samples. Most of the samples are adopted from the first reference. Even many of the comments are quoted from it. I strongly recommend studying the first reference, if you are learning C++ as a *first* programming language.
